# ReactJs development environment

A simple ReactJs development environment setup using webpack and babel to transpile es2015.

## Get started

Clone the repository to your local machine and then run `npm install`. This will bring down react, react-toolbox and classnames, along with the development dependencies like babel and webpack.

Once downloaded, run `npm run build` to compile the project, and then open the `./bin/index.html` file to view the ReactJs example component in the browser.

The following ReactJs component should be rendered to the view.

```
const App = () => (
  <div>Hello World from React!</div>
);
```
